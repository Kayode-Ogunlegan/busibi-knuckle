Hi! My name is Oluwakayode Ogunlegan.
I am a 16 year old rising junior and one of my goals is to complete the KKCF program with good grades.
I hope to learn as much as possible from the program, and that it it's impact on my career is substantial.

My hobbies include playing video games, going outside, and spending time with my family and friends.
I also like going to the gym and staying in shape.

For my educational experiences, I am an honor roll student maintaining a 3.3 GPA per quarter at the bare minimum.
I am currently enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Program at my school, and hope it also opens many doors for my career.

I don't have much professional experience, the KKCF Program is actually the first internship I have ever done, but its looking to be extremly promising.

Heres what I look like:
